## Settings Config

Some application configurations can be modified in the `res/settings.json` file. Below is an example of the settings you can adjust:

```json
{
  "startup": true,
  "toggle_key": "`",
  "toggle_direction": "random",
  "default_pos": true
}
```

- **startup:** Run the application at startup. (`true`/`false`)
- **toggle_key:** The hotkey to toggle the application.
- **toggle_direction:** (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`/`random`).
- **default_pos:** Disable custom window positions (`true`/`false`)

## Adding Custom Windows

To create a new window, you can add a Python script to the `windows` directory and enable it in the `res/settings.json` file. You can use the template provided in `windows/temp.py` as a starting point.

1. **Add your Python script:**

   - Create a new Python file in the `windows` directory. For example, `my_custom_window.py`.

2. **Enable the new window:**
   - Open the `res/settings.json` file.
   - Add an entry for your new window in the JSON configuration. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "windows": [
         {
           "script": "my_custom_window.py"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

By following these steps, you can easily add custom windows without rebuilding the application.
